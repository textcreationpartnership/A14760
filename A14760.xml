            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

In the end, h√©e addeth this as the chiefest: <hi>These and many moe plagues the Lord will lay vpon thee, if thou doe not feare the glorious and fearefull name of the Lord, Psal.</hi> 8. <hi>O Lord our God howe excellent is thy name in all the world!</hi> The <note place="margin">Aben Ezra.</note> Egyptians had a custome to sweare by the head of their king, which othe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer did not performe, might not b√©e red√©emed from death by any ransome, bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he despised the king: how much more then ought not w√©e to name, or so much as once thinke of the name of our glorious God, but with feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? <hi>Exodus</hi> 20. <hi>Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine.</hi> As w√©e must take h√©ede of the errour of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists, so we must not take Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly name in vaine, but vse it reuerently, with feare and trembling.

            <p>Againe, some doe not onely so abuse Gods glorious Name in their idle and ordinary talke, but also by vaine swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring doe binde, almost euery word with an oath, whereby also they bring Gods heauie iudgements, woes, and curses vpon their owne heads, yea, some can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not speake vnlesse they swrare: It is their Rethoricke, the vulgar poyson of the world, and it is in the mouth of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20114:10"/> child, for as soone as they can speake, they are able to hurle out any oath, as if they had b√©ene old practicioners. It is an horrible thing to see how this sinne is vsed in all companies, the old man sweareth of custome, the young man in a brauery, the childe by immitation, the Gentleman thinks his sp√©ech not grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous if hee grace it not with gracelesse oathes; the poore man sweareth for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, the thiefe to couer his fault, and the strumpet sweareth to deny her sin. A vaine swearer is worse then a thiefe, an harlot, or a slaunderer: the thiefe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten stealeth for necessitie, the swearer stealeth Gods glory in a brauery, the harlot sinneth in the darke, the swearer openly: the slaunderer hurts his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the swearer offends his heauenly Father. The souldier once pearced Christ with a speare. <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. but swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers with their poysoned tongs breake vp all the wounds of Christ, and tread vnder their f√©et the blood of the couenant they are worse then the Deuill, who trembleth at the name of Christ, but they without feare or reuerence doe most horribly blaspheme it. A man is
<pb facs="tcp:20114:11"/> knowne of what hart he is by his swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; for as the Apostle saint <hi>Peter</hi> was knowne to be of <hi>Galile,</hi> by his sp√©ech, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 70. so a man (because of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of the heart the mouth speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth) may know the children of God, the children of the world, and the children of the Diuell by their sp√©ech. Of the first <hi>Dauid</hi> speaketh <hi>Psal.</hi> 84. <hi>Blessed are they that dwell in thine house, they will euer praise thee.</hi> Of the second sort <hi>Iohn</hi> saith 3. 31. <hi>He that is of the earth is of the earth, and speaketh of the earth.</hi> And of the third the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> saith, <hi>Esay</hi> 1. 21, 22. <hi>They fret themselues, and curse their Kings, and their gods.</hi> As h√©e is an English man that naturally speaketh English, a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard that naturally speaketh Spanish, and a French man that naturally speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth French: so they that in their vsuall sp√©ech doe praise God, are of God: they that speake most of earthly things, are worldly and carnall men: but they that vse much swearing and cursing, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellish, because their sp√©ech is alike. In the auntient Records of the Romans it <note place="margin">Iohannes Beetes in preceptorio.</note> is remembred, that a certaine adultresse hauing thr√©e sonnes, tolde her husband,
<pb facs="tcp:20114:11"/> when she lay on her death bed, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of them was his, but which of them it was, she would not at any hand make knowne. At last, when the time came also that this man should departe the world, he bequeathed to his vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen sonne all his lands and goodes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating his executors that they would vse all the best meanes they could, to know which of them thr√©e was his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sonne: the matter was brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iudge, who calling to minde the wise fact of king <hi>Salomon</hi> concerning the two women that contended for the liuing childe 1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 3. thought it good to make experience where Nature rested: and therefore gaue sentence, that the dead body of the father should be boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vpright to a stake, and that to euery of the thr√©e children should be deliuered a bowe and an arrowe, and each one of them should shoot his arrow at the dead body, with promise, that he which could shoot n√©erest the fathers heart, and pierce deepest into his flesh, should haue land, goodes, and all. The two bastardes (in whome was no sparke of naturall loue) shot earnestly at him, but the third with
<pb facs="tcp:20114:12"/> reuerence refused to shoot, abhorring to doe so vnnaturall an action, and sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprooued his brethren, for commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so filthy a fact, affirming that hee had rather loose all, then doe as they had done: whereuppon iudgement was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen that he was the dead mans onely and naturall sonne, and the other two but bastards, and so enioyed his fathers inheritance. Such bastards are they and no true children of God, which in their dayly talke shoote out arrowes of blasphemy at euery part of Christ his sacred body, they cannot beare any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall loue to Christ that so wound him with oathes, and shoot at his heart, nay, they are Gods enemies. <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 20. <hi>Thine enemies (O Lord) take thy Name in vaine.</hi> As the Salamander which way soeuer he goeth powreth out his poyson, which maketh the herbes to wither; so there are some, who which way soeuer they goe, doe powre out the poyson of their soules.

            <p>Thirdly, the glorious and fearefull name of the Lord God is vnreuerently abused among the wicked by their false swearing to deceiue, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16. <hi>God hath appointed an oath as an end of all controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and a seale of the truth.</hi> But false swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers take the seale of God, &amp; counterfeit it. He that counterfeits the seale of a prince is worthy of death: then what of him that taketh the seale of Gods name to confirme a lye withall? It was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable thing that the Iewes required not Iesus, but <hi>Barrabas,</hi> a thiefe and a murtherer: So periured persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Iesus Christ, &amp; the hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, the kingdome of God, and all they regard not so much the safgard of
<pb facs="tcp:20114:13"/> their owne soules, as the fauour of some mortall man, and as <hi>Iudas</hi> solde Christ for thirty pence, so they renounce Christ Iesus and the kingdome of heauen for a summe of mony, or worldly commodity.</p>
            <p>This swearing falsely, to deceiue, is too common a sinne: As the Cretians were saide to be all liars, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 12. so for the most part, among vs, all are swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to gaine by it. This is too vsuall a sinne in shoppes, faires, and markets, and I would God no where else. That which is so gotten, hath a fearefull curse vpon it. Maisters will teach their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to sweare for gain, and such bring in most profite. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> lusted for water of the well of <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi> the thr√©e Woorthies brake into the host of the Philistims, in danger of their liues, and drew water out of the well of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and brought it to <hi>Dauid,</hi> who would not drinke thereof, but powred it out for an offering to the Lord, saying, <hi>O Lord, be it farre from me that I should doe this, Is not this the bloud of the men that went in ieoperdie of their liues?</hi> Therefore he would not drincke of it. If <hi>Dauid</hi> would not drinke of the water that was
<pb facs="tcp:20114:13"/> fetched with danger of those mens liues, wilt thou eate and drinke of that which is gotten with danger of the soule of thy child, seruant, or their owne soule? Let men take h√©ede, swearing falsly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue is but mad sport, whereby mens soules are endangered, but it is so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon that it sheweth how few take care for their soules. It would make a mans heart quake to here how the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, when they s√©eke to deceiue them with whom they deale, will sweare and take God to witnesse. 1. <hi>Samu.</hi> 28. <hi>Saul</hi> going to the witch to deceiue, put on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apparel: So men purposing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, take on them the name of God as a cloke: Woe to th√©e then whosoeuer thou art, that so takest Gods glorious Name into thy mouth to confirme a lye withall, therby to deceiue thy neighbor, God will make thy plagues wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, great, and fearefull.</p>
            <p>Further, I obserue that as the name of God is many wayes vnreuerently abused, so the Lorde will send downe Iudgements, woes, and plagues vpon them in this life, and eternall curses in the life to come, which do not with great
<pb facs="tcp:20114:14"/> feare and reuerence vse the glorious and fearefull Name of the Lord. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 7. <hi>The Lord will not holde him guiltlesse, that taketh his name in vaine.</hi> If all the iudges and courts on earth acquit him, God will condemne him.

You see how great and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a flame a blasphemous tongue kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 5. If then God send downe such wonderful plagues on them which do not with great feare &amp; reuerence vse his dreadful name, then (beloued) it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied but that this present iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God by plague and pestilence is iustly fallen vpon our English nation: For (alas) how often, and how rashly is that fearefull &amp; glorious Name of God blasphemed among vs? Some thinke there is no grace in their words, if they be not imbossed with damnable oaths, &amp; notwithstanding, who trembleth at it? Nay, who almost reprooueth it? The <hi>Iewes</hi> rent their garments, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 65. when they heard Gods Name blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but who among vs sheweth any
<pb facs="tcp:20114:15"/> token that he is discontented with it? If <hi>Pilate</hi> an Heathen man, who knewe <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. 7.</note> not Gods word, was stricken with feare at the hearing of the name of the Sonne of God: No doubt <hi>Pilate</hi> shall rise vp in iudgement against many among vs, who without all feare and reuerence rende the Name of God in pieces by cursed swearing and blasphemie, and tosse that dreadfull Name of God in their mouthes, as a football is tossed too and fro on the plaine ground. Some maruell to s√©e Lordshippes, houses, and landes translated to strangers from the ancient owners: maruell not at it, there are many houses wherein that fearefull and terrible Name of God is seldome remembred, vnlesse it be to Gods disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and therefore Gods vengeance doeth watch for their destruction, and a secret curse remaineth in their houses; God will make their plagues wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the plagues of their seed, till he haue vtterly destroyed them from off the face of the earth: Others wonder to s√©e this man or that suddenly stricken dumbe, and depriued of sp√©ech, euen in time of their health: If thou wonder at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20114:15"/> it, glorifie God in thine admiration, for it standeth with Gods iustice that wherein a man sinneth, therein he shall be punished: and therfore as to the rich glutton, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. who sometime had his choice of drinke and daintie fare, but abused it, a time came (by Gods iust iudgement) when he would haue b√©ene glad of a droppe of water to coole his tongue: So it is a iust thing with God that they which abuse their speech by swearing and cursing (which is a gift that no creature but man hath) should in their life time be depriued of speech, and left dumbe as brute beasts, that others might s√©e &amp; feare, and by their example take heed how they do vnreuerently vse Gods sacred Name. Some againe thinke it strange that God doth at one time threaten vs with sword, at another time punished vs with dearth &amp; famine, and eftsoones with fearefull plague and pestelence, as at this present; but let them thinke it more strange that God doth not rayne fire and brimstone from heauen vpon vs, as he did vpon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah, Gen.</hi> 19. or that the earth doeth not swallow vs vp quicke, as it
<pb facs="tcp:20114:16"/> did <hi>Corah</hi> and his company, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16. 32, 33. for our beastly and blasphemous swearing, and vnreuerent trampling of Gods feareful Name vnder our f√©ete. Take h√©ede then whosoeuer thou art, how by thy filthy swearing, thou blo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west at the coale of Gods curse, and kindlest the wrath of God as a fire to consume th√©e, and thy posterity; And as thou tenderest the glory of God, the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of thy soule, or wouldest haue these present iudgments of God remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or taken away from vs, repent th√©e of this and other thy sinnes, that God may command his punishing Angel to stay his hand.</p>
            <p>Hitherto you haue heard how God threatneth iudgments, first, against the dissobedient, and secondly, against such as doe not feare that glorious and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Name, <hi>The Lord God.</hi> Now in the second generall place you shall heare what maner of seruice the Lord requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for the auoydance of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and that is, That we doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly h√©ere, but also k√©epe and doe all the the words of this Law.</p>
            <p>They that would haue the splendent

For manifest proofe of which doctrine, though the Spirit of God sets downe sufficient of this in the 28. of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> and <hi>Leutt.</hi> 26. yet I <note place="margin">

The people of <hi>Sodoma</hi> often heard <hi>Lot,</hi> but their hearing was to their further c≈çdemnation, because they did not obserue and doe that they heard. The Iewes, the people of God had Prophets, and good men sent vnto
<pb facs="tcp:20114:17"/> them, to call them to repentance, yea, Christ Iesus and his Apostles, but what they heard, serued but as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against them, because they y√©elded not obedience to that they heard, the Iudgements of God fell vpon them in most fearefull maner, and God made their plagues wonderfull, &amp; the plagues of their s√©ede. The wicked and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ones may heare the worde, and talke of the worde, but the k√©eping and doing of it is onely proper to the elect children of God.

Secondly, because sinne maketh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a separation betw√©ene God and vs. <hi>Esay</hi> 59. 2. <hi>Your iniquities haue separated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene you and your God, and your sinnes haue hid his face from you, that he will not heare. Iere.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Your iniquities haue tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned away these things, and your sinnes haue hindred good things from you.</hi> Thirdly, because euery sinne doth purchase Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wrath. <hi>Psal.</hi> 5. 4, 5. <hi>For thou art not a God that loueth wickednesse, neither shall euill dwell with thee. The foolish shall not stand in thy sight, for thou hatest all them that worke iniquity Rom.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>The wrath of God is reueiled from heauen against al vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnes and vngodlinesse of men, which</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:20114:22"/>
               <hi>withhold the truth in righteousnes.</hi> Our sins do bring down Gods wrath and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by famine, sword, plague, &amp; pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and therefore if we would be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from these iudgments which late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in fearefull manner lye vpon vs, we must make conscience to k√©epe and doe <hi>All the words of Gods Law.</hi> This doctrine also serueth to reproue them that are carelesse in sin, and make no bones to commit sinne euen with gr√©edinesse, we should pul such as it were out of the fire. <hi>Iud.</hi> 23. For sin is as dangerous to the soule as fire is to the body. Moreouer, we should auoyd all occasions of sin, and vse all good meanes to k√©epe vs vndefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therwith, to frequent good company, and auoyd badde, for if we be carefull to shunne such places and persons as are infected with the plague, and to vse all preseruatiues against it, then much more against sinne, which is the plague and poyson of the soule. Lastly, this serueth to condemne the sinfull shifting which some vse to make from one sinne to another: I haue b√©ene an adulterer (will some man say) but I thanke God, I haue left that sinne, and now I am
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20114:22"/> but a little couetous, &amp;c. But as one poyson is enough to destroy the bodie, so one sinne is sufficient to condemne the soule. We must not doe as <hi>Saul</hi> did, who being sent to destroy all the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 3, 9. spared their King <hi>Agag,</hi> and the better sh√©epe and oxen, and the fat beasts, and the lambes, and all that was good, that they would not destroy, but all that was vile and nought worth, that they destroyed: So we must not thinke it sufficient to cast away one sinne, or a few sinnes, but we must destroy our fatte sinnes, our profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table sinnes, our pleasant sinnes, and all. If we would haue our land clensed from infection of plague and pestilence, we must labour to clense our selues, first, from all filthinesse of flesh and Spirit, we must k√©epe and doe not this or that <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</note> part, but all the words of Gods Lawe. God giueth no man libertie to commit the least sin: and therefore as we would haue all parts glorified, so we must also first haue all parts sanctified, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU haue heard in the former sermon. First a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whome the Lord here threatneth plagues, and Iudgements, <hi>viz.</hi> the disobedient, and them that feare not his glorious Name. And secondly, what maner of seruice he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, for auoyding of his Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, namely, not onely the hearing, but also the keeping and doing of his Law, and that not of this or that part of it, but of all the words of his Law.</p>
            <p>Now commeth the third general part to bee handled, which doth shewe the cause of the iudgements of God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and now fallen vpon vs, &amp; that is, sin, or the not k√©eping and doing of al the wordes of Gods Law. But first let me answere one obiection which may hence arise. Some man may say, Why doeth
<pb facs="tcp:20114:24"/> God threaten temporall plagues and punishments in this life, and eternall torments in the life to come against those that doe not obserue and doe all the words of his Law, whereas (Christ onely excepted) no man can, nor euer did performe and doe the whole law so perfectly and absolutly as God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth at our hands? To this I answere: The Lord requireth nothing but what we are bounden to doe, and that wee might haue done had not <hi>Adam</hi> sinned: And therefore considering the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our nature, we ought to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our frailtie, and to call vpon God by faithful prayer, that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe by his holy Spirit to direct vs how to frame our liues according to his Law, and accept of vs in Christ and for his sake, who hath fulfilled the Law for vs. And although the best Saints of God be farre short of that perfection which the Lord requireth, yet let it bee our comfort that the Lord accepteth of our willingnesse, and desire to doe that he commandeth: So he accepted of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, Gen.</hi> 22. 10. And so also will hee <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 10, 11 12.</note> accept of all <hi>Abrahams</hi> children: For
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20114:24"/> though <hi>Abraham</hi> did not sacrifice his son yet his willingnesse to haue done it at Gods commandement, was accepted as if he had done it: So if thou haue a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling minde, and vnfained desire to k√©epe and doe all the wordes of Gods Lawe, though thou come much too short of it, yet the Lord will accept of thy willing mind &amp; vnfained desire to do it, as if thou haddest done it. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 11. But will <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1. 11.</note> a willing minde &amp; vnfained desire serue the turne? Yes, If thou labour to walke in the feare of God, and desirest more faith, when thou hast not so much as thou wouldest haue: If, I say, thou desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in thine heart, not to offend God, f√©elest wants in thy selfe, thirstest to doe better, &amp; f√©elest an inward griefe y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> thou canst do no better, thy willing mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboue thine hability, doubtlesse God doth accept of th√©e as if thou hadest kept and done al y<seg rend="sup">e</seg> words of his Law. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 2, 12.</note> 8. <hi>If first there be a willing mind, it is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to that a man hath, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath not.</hi> If a father wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to prooue the obedience of his child, should bid him goe, &amp; fetch such a great ston, which he knew wel enough he were
<pb facs="tcp:20114:25"/> not able to mooue, much lesse to carie, the child should goe and strugle with it, and finding that he could not by any meanes doe it, should returne to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and tell him, Father, I haue done what I am able, and vsed all my strength, but it will not be: What fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it, that will not accept of his chiids willing minde and endeuour, as if he had done it? So our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accepteth of our willing and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mindes, though we be not able to k√©epe and doe all the words of his Law.</p>
            <p>But to our purpose, What is the cause of Gods iudgements? Sinne, for it doeth kindle the wrath of God as a fire, and brings down his iudgements. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 39. <hi>Man suffereth for his sin. Psal.</hi>

            <p>The Scriptures doe also mention certaine particular sinnes, for which God threatneth &amp; inflicteth the plague and pestilence vpon the people.

If want of worshiping and seruing of God be one cause of the pestilence, then such prophane wretches amongst vs as had rather doe any thing then come to Church to serue God, are as cartropes to drawe downe the plague vpon this our English nation. And, as the <hi>Iewes</hi>

            <p>Though Idolatry be taken out of our Churches, yet secret Idolatry is committed in many places: And besides that, whatsoeuer a man loueth as much or more then God, it is his Idole, and he committeth Idolatry therewith. 2. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 2. 10.</note>

               <hi>like mine?</hi> The reasons why God doeth thus afflict his owne people are many. First, the people of God are tyed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and to glorifie Gods Name; but when they sinne, they make his glory and Name to be blasphemed, and their profession to be dishonoured, and therefore God punisheth them more grieuously. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. So <hi>Dauid</hi> by <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14.</note> his sinne made the enemies of God to blaspheme. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24.

                  <hi>Ro. m</hi> 2. 24.</note> for not k√©eping the Lawe, <hi>The Name of God</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed among the Gentiles through you:</hi> And this also is one speciall cause wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord thus punisheth vs, we are now Gods people, bounden so obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as were the <hi>Iewes,</hi> but (alas) many among vs dishonour their profession,
<pb facs="tcp:20114:40"/> and by their badde conuersation make the Gospell to bee blasphemed, and ill spoken of, and therefore he executeth his iudgements vpon vs.</p>
            <p>A second reason wherefore God so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> afflicteth his deerest children is, that as he aduaunceth them highest by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, so if they abuse, or contemne them, it is right that he should cast them down to greatest miseries.

            <p>Secondly, if God haue not spared his d√©erest seruants, in their sinnes, w√©e must not spare, nor beare with them that are n√©ere vnto vs, or d√©ere vnto vs, but reprooue them roundly for their sinnes. And that in loue to their soules.
<pb facs="tcp:20114:41"/> Let not the Minister beare with any for friendshippe or fauoure, but reprooue them, and deale faithfully with all. And let the fearefull example of <hi>Elie</hi> serue as a looking-glasse to all parentes, not to bolster their children in any bad actions, but sharpely to corect them. <hi>Ely,</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wickednesse of his sonnes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued them in d√©ed, but with too much lenitie, as good neuer a white, as neuer the better. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 23. <hi>Why doe yee</hi>

               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 18.</note> 4. 18. the iudgements of God ouertooke, him, for, being old, he fell from his seate backeward, and brake his necke, and died. We haue many <hi>Elies</hi> now a daies, who hearing and knowing of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of their children, and seruants, haue learned without booke <hi>Ely</hi> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of reprouing. <hi>Why doe you thus? doe no more so.</hi> But let them take h√©ede lest the like or worse Iudgementes fall on them. As God hateth and punisheth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20114:41"/> sinne in his owne people, and deerest seruants: so doe thou hate sinne, and condemne it, both in thy self and others. He hateth sinne so much, that if thou were as the signet of his fingar, hee would plucke th√©e off, if thou sin against him. A godly father will not beare with his childe in wickednesse, because hee loueth him: the husband will not smother vp his wiues faultes, but by gentle perswasions, or (if that will not serue) with sharpe reprehensions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue her, because he loueth her: So God oft times aflicteth his children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he loueth them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, whereas God doeth for the most parte, sharpely correct his owne people in this life, we ought not rashely to iudge, nor condemne those that are here most subiect to crosses and aflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, If we s√©e Gods hand extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily heauie vpon any man, let vs not therefore giue sentence vpon him that he is a badde man, or a reprobate: So <hi>Iobs</hi> frendes dealt with him, when they sawe his strong aflictions, they inferred that hee was an hypocrite, and God <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iob</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Iob</hi> 15. 34. <hi>Iob</hi> 20 4, 5.</note> punished him for his sinnes: but of all
<pb facs="tcp:20114:42"/>
               <hi>Iobs</hi> afflictions none troubled him more then this. So Christ was accounted a badde man because hee had many <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 53. 3.</note> troubles: Whereas hee was without any spot of sinne, neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny guile found in his mouth. Let vs not then iudge hardly of those that are afflicted, because God will so trie his deerest children; and by many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations we must enter into eternall Ioy: We may not looke to goe to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen on a fether-bedde, but if wee see a notorious badde man afflicted, then we may say, such a man is punished for his sinnes.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I note that God doeth here threaten to punish disobedience and prophanation of his name euen in a mans posterity. <hi>I will make</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>thy plagues wonderfull, and the plagues of thy seede.</hi> The Iewes for their disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and contempt of Gods Lawe, did not onely feele and finde in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the iudgements of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so their posterity smarted for it: It was the cause of the ouerthrowe of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and that so many thousands (as I haue shewed you) perished there<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20114:42"/> sword, famine, plague, and pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: It was the cause of the Iewes captiuitie, and that their seede and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritte are made vagabonds vpon the earth. <hi>Genes.</hi> 9. 25. <hi>Cham</hi> did no more but discouer the priuie parts of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">

Howe much more shall they feele the iudgements of God vpon themselues and their seede, which doe not only diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Gods c≈çmandements, but also cast away the feare of his glorious Name, which ought not once to bee spoken of, nor so much as thought vpon, but with reuerence? <hi>Iosh.</hi> 9. 15.

<pb facs="tcp:20114:43"/> forswearing himselfe, and rebelling, was periured: The Lord punished his perinry by the King of Babylon, who tooke him prisoner, slewe his sonnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his face, then put out both his eyes, and caryed him bound into Babylon, where he was kept in misery. <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth tooke a solemne oath at <hi>Yorke,</hi>
